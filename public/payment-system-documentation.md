## Core Components

### PaymentManager Class

The main payment processing class that handles all payment operations.

#### Key Methods:

- `init()` - Initialize payment system
- `getAvailablePaymentMethods()` - Get list of supported payment methods
- `processPayment(booking, method)` - Process payment for a booking
- `handlePaymentSuccess(result)` - Handle successful payment
- `handlePaymentFailure(error)` - Handle payment failure
- `processMockPayment(data)` - Process mock payment for testing

### Payment Methods

The system supports multiple payment methods:

1. **Card Payments** (💳) - Credit/debit card processing
2. **Bank Transfer** (🏦) - Direct bank transfers
3. **Mobile Money** (📱) - Mobile payment solutions
4. **PayPal** (🌐) - PayPal integration
5. **Crypto** (₿) - Cryptocurrency payments

## Integration Points

### Booking System Integration

The payment system integrates with the booking system through:

```javascript
// In checkout.html
const booking = BookingManager.getBooking();
const result = await PaymentManager.processPayment(booking);
```

### Success Flow

1. User completes booking
2. System processes payment
3. On success: redirect to `payment-success.html`
4. Booking details displayed with confetti animation
5. Cart updated, booking cleared after display

### Failure Flow

1. Payment processing fails
2. Redirect to `payment-failed.html`
3. Error details displayed
4. Multiple retry options provided
5. Alternative payment methods offered

## Error Handling

### Built-in Error Types

- **Network errors** - Automatic retry with fallback
- **Payment gateway errors** - Alternative method suggestions
- **Validation errors** - User-friendly error messages
- **Timeout errors** - Automatic retry mechanism

### Recovery Mechanisms

- **Automatic retry** - 3 attempts with increasing delays
- **Fallback methods** - Try alternative payment methods
- **Error persistence** - Store error details for support
- **User guidance** - Clear instructions for resolution

## Testing

### Test Suite

The `test-payment-system.html` provides comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Run the test suite by opening in browser
open test-payment-system.html
```

### Test Coverage

- System initialization
- Payment method availability
- Mock payment processing
- Error handling
- Integration with booking system
- Success/failure flows

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```javascript
// Default configuration
const config = {
  apiBase: "https://techyjaunt-auth-go43.onrender.com",
  maxRetries: 3,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  timeout: 30000,
  supportedCurrencies: ['NGN', 'USD', 'EUR']
};
```

### Customization

To add new payment methods:

```javascript
PaymentManager.addPaymentMethod({
  id: 'new_method',
  name: 'New Payment Method',
  icon: '✨',
  description: 'Description of new method',
  processor: async (booking) => {
    // Custom payment processing logic
  }
});
```

## Security Features

- **Token-based authentication** - JWT tokens for API calls
- **Input validation** - Comprehensive booking validation
- **Error sanitization** - Prevent information leakage
- **Secure storage** - Local storage with encryption considerations
- **CSRF protection** - Token validation for all requests

## Performance Optimizations

- **Caching** - Payment method configuration caching
- **Connection pooling** - Reusable API connections
- **Debounced retries** - Smart retry timing
- **Progressive enhancement** - Fallback to basic functionality

## Browser Support

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Payment methods not loading**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify API endpoint accessibility

2. **Payment processing fails**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify booking data validity

3. **Redirect issues**
   - Check if success/failure pages exist
   - Verify localStorage permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debugPayment', 'true');

## Migration Guide

### From Old System

1. Include new payment script:

   <script src="payment-fix-enhanced.js"></script>
   ```

2. Update checkout page to use new API:
   ```javascript
   // Old: initiatePayment()

   ```

3. Update success/failure page redirects

### Backward Compatibility

3. **Provide user feedback** during processing
4. **Handle edge cases** (no internet, API downtime)
5. **Test thoroughly** with different scenarios
